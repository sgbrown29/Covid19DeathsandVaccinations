# Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations Project

This is a data exploration project that examines the death and vaccination rates of the world during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  I will also soon create a Tableau dashboard to visualize this data, which can be accessed through my Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steven.brown8512).

### Data Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for initial data organizing)
- BigQuery SQL Workspace (for queries)

### Data Source
- [OurWorldinData.org Covid Deaths Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
